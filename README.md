# Fitbit Project- Using Python for analysis data 

### Outline for final project in Code Kentucky Program.

Hello, I'm Savanna Booten- a student and currently learning Python through _Code Kentucky_. This program is an online program preparing people in Kentucky for jobs in tech. While in this proram we are tasked to create a project using python. 

For my project I wanted to use the data from my _fitbit_ watch and analyze my sleep and the number of steps I walked in a month. I choose this in hopes I can get a better understanding on how to improve my overall health.

1.  Install Anaconda.
2. Open Jupyter Notebooks- I use VS code 
3. Clone  this repository. To use this code, type the following into a command terminal:
> git clone https://github.com/sbooten0002/CodeKy.git
